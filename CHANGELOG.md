## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: bun workspace monorepo, shared TypeScript and lint configuration, the agent
  contract in `AGENTS.md`, the documentation set in `docs/`, CI, and the contributor guides.
- Market and business model: `docs/04-market.md` and `docs/05-business-model.md`, with the competitor
  map, bottom-up TAM, SAM and SOM, unit economics, payback and the go-to-market plan. Every figure is
  cited to a public primary source with its access date.
- Expected-loss decision engine in `packages/core/src/decision.ts`. `decide` turns findings into
  hold, verify or release by weighing the pesos at risk against what delaying the payment costs
  with that supplier, and never auto-releases while a critical finding exists. `composeFindings`
  runs whichever of the six detectors exist in the package and returns their findings in alert
  rail order, biggest amount at risk first.
- CLABE forensics detector in `packages/core`: check digit over the 3-7-1 weights, a dated snapshot
  of the Banxico participant catalogue, plaza parsing, OCR-aware Damerau-Levenshtein against the
  supplier's paid accounts, and a `Finding` whose evidence names the differing digit positions.
- `packages/core/src/cfdi.ts`: CFDI 4.0 de ingreso and complemento de recepcion de pagos 2.0 parsed
  into the domain types, on a dependency-free XML tokenizer that never throws. Synthetic SAT
  fixtures in `packages/core/src/fixtures/` and 62 tests covering totals, IVA, the timbre UUID, the
  beneficiary account, missing optional nodes and malformed input.
