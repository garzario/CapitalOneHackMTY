## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: bun workspace monorepo, shared TypeScript and lint configuration, the agent
  contract in `AGENTS.md`, the documentation set in `docs/`, CI, and the contributor guides.
- `packages/cep`: Banxico CEP reader. `parseCep` over the `SPEI_Tercero` document, `verifySignature`
  which runs the candidate matrix and reports `unconfirmed_scheme` rather than claiming a seal it
  cannot prove, `fetchCep` against the public portal with an injectable fetch, and `nameMatch` with
  Mexican legal-name normalisation. Synthetic fixture, zero dependencies, no network in the tests.
- `packages/core/src/cfdi.ts`: CFDI 4.0 de ingreso and complemento de recepcion de pagos 2.0 parsed
  into the domain types, on a dependency-free XML tokenizer that never throws. Synthetic SAT
  fixtures in `packages/core/src/fixtures/` and 62 tests covering totals, IVA, the timbre UUID, the
  beneficiary account, missing optional nodes and malformed input.
