Whoever merges a pull request appends its entry to `[Unreleased]` in the same commit. Exactly one
version is cut for this event, `[1.0.0]` at M4, and tagged.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `packages/engine`: the six controls of ADR-0002 behind one call, `runControls(input)`. It holds
  the two adapters that `packages/core` cannot hold without a dependency cycle, `sat_69b` over
  `matchRfc` plus the retroactive `SweepResult` exposure, and `beneficiary_cep` over `nameMatch`
  and the CEP signature state. `apps/api` depends on it.
- `matchRfc` in `packages/sat`: the Article 69-B situation in force for one RFC, newest DOF
  publication first, so a taxpayer who cleared their name is never reported as listed.
- `Supplier.delayCostPerDay`, optional, with a documented default of zero, and `supplierModelOf`
  in `packages/core` to read it. The expected-loss engine now weighs the delay against a number on
  the supplier record instead of a constant in a route handler.
- `Repository.allComplements` and `Repository.bankMirror` in `apps/api`, so the duplicate and
  reconciliation controls see every complement and the Nessie bank statement.
- Repository bootstrap: bun workspace monorepo, shared TypeScript and lint configuration, the agent
  contract in `AGENTS.md`, the documentation set in `docs/`, CI, and the contributor guides.
- `apps/api` scaffold for the contract in `docs/09-api.md`: one file per route group under
  `src/routes`, zod schemas for every request and response derived from the domain types, a
  `Repository` interface with an in-memory implementation seeded with a synthetic payment run, the
  Server-Sent Events broadcaster behind `GET /api/v1/events`, and the intake pipeline that runs the
  detectors and the expected-loss decision engine in `@hackmty/core`.
- `apps/web` scaffold: design tokens, a typed client for the contract in `docs/09-api.md` with the
  Server-Sent Events hook, a dependency-free hash router, the synthetic payment run the app falls
  back to when the API is absent, and the six screens (payment run, instruction detail, QR intake,
  Article 69-B simulation and lookup, CEP viewer, blind evaluation).
- `packages/cep`: Banxico CEP reader. `parseCep` over the `SPEI_Tercero` document, `verifySignature`
  which runs the candidate matrix and reports `unconfirmed_scheme` rather than claiming a seal it
  cannot prove, `fetchCep` against the public portal with an injectable fetch, and `nameMatch` with
  Mexican legal-name normalisation. Synthetic fixture, zero dependencies, no network in the tests.
- `docs/06-regulatory-privacy.md`: regulatory posture, privacy and LLM boundary for Ceptinela.
  Legal position, framework map for Mexico, the verified text of CFF articles 69-B and 69-B Bis,
  the LFPDPPP obligations over CEP holder names and supplier data, the ethics rules the domain
  types enforce, a cost per verification table priced on 2026-09-12, and the synthetic data
  posture. Every legal and price claim is traced to a primary source in a sources table.
- Market and business model: `docs/04-market.md` and `docs/05-business-model.md`, with the competitor
  map, bottom-up TAM, SAM and SOM, unit economics, payback and the go-to-market plan. Every figure is
  cited to a public primary source with its access date.
- Expected-loss decision engine in `packages/core/src/decision.ts`. `decide` turns findings into
  hold, verify or release by weighing the pesos at risk against what delaying the payment costs
  with that supplier, and never auto-releases while a critical finding exists. `composeFindings`
  runs whichever of the six detectors exist in the package and returns their findings in alert
  rail order, biggest amount at risk first.
- CLABE forensics detector in `packages/core`: check digit over the 3-7-1 weights, a dated snapshot
  of the Banxico participant catalogue, plaza parsing, OCR-aware Damerau-Levenshtein against the
  supplier's paid accounts, and a `Finding` whose evidence names the differing digit positions.
- `packages/core/src/cfdi.ts`: CFDI 4.0 de ingreso and complemento de recepcion de pagos 2.0 parsed
  into the domain types, on a dependency-free XML tokenizer that never throws. Synthetic SAT
  fixtures in `packages/core/src/fixtures/` and 62 tests covering totals, IVA, the timbre UUID, the
  beneficiary account, missing optional nodes and malformed input.

### Changed

### Fixed

- The detector registry in `packages/core/src/decision.ts`. It discovered detector modules by
  dynamic import and guessed each one's argument tuple from its arity, so once the real detectors
  landed it called none of them and `composeFindings` returned an empty array for all six slots
  while the tests stayed green. It is replaced by explicit, typed `DetectorAdapter`s over a single
  `ComposeInput`, and `composeFindingsReport` now accounts for every control in either `ran` or
  `skipped` with a named reason, so silence can never be read as a clean payment again.
- `isFinding` rejected `subject.kind: "ledger_tx"`, which the domain contract allows, so every
  `unbacked_outflow` from the reconciliation detector was dropped before it reached the clerk.

### Removed

- The dynamic `DETECTOR_REGISTRY`, `asDetectorModule` and the call-shape guessing in
  `packages/core/src/decision.ts`, together with the detector wiring `apps/api/src/pipeline.ts`
  carried to work around them.
